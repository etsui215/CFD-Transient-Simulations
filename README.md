# Comparative Analysis of a Student-Scaled Bell Nozzle to a Full-Length Conical Aerospike Nozzle
Abstract: <br>
This study compares flow characteristics and nozzle performance between a conventional bell nozzle and a full-length conical aerospike nozzle through numerical simulation, both scaled to fit within the constraints of a hypothetical student-built rocket engine. Design requirements were derived from previously built student rocket engines to ensure relevance and applicability. Fluid flow for the bell nozzle and aerospike nozzle were analyzed at three different ratios of ambient pressure to design pressure (P_ambient/P_design), representing under-expansion, optimum, and overexpansion working conditions. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the bell nozzle using nozzle length percentages (percentage of bell nozzle length to the reference conical nozzle with a 15Â° half angle) of 60%, 80%, and 100%. Results showed that the 80% bell nozzle demonstrated the highest thrust performance in optimum conditions within the bell nozzles that were studied. There was also a 1.18% increase in thrust for the aerospike nozzle in overexpansion conditions and a 0.62% decrease in thrust at design conditions compared to the 80% bell nozzle. While these findings offer insights into nozzle design and performance for student-built rocket engines, future research can explore practical design parameters, such as plug truncation percentage and weight reduction, while also investigating different nozzle types and propellant combinations for further optimization.
